Revision history for MARC::Charset

0.6  Thu Feb 26 10:26:22 2004
    - fixed MARC::Charset::EastAsian to not hexify results of character lookup
      since we are now storing hex values in the BerkeleyDB.
    - also fixed the method for looking up the location of the BerkeleyDB
      so that the testing version takes precedence over one that is 
      installed. This is why the above error was not detected during 
      testing.

0.5  Fri Apr 11 06:47:00 2003
    - all Charset classes inherit from MARC::Charset::Generic
    - added MARC::Charset::UTF8
    - added MARC::Charset::to_marc8() for conversion of UTF8 back to MARC8
    - t/115.utf8.t basic tests of to_marc8()
    - modified Makefile.PL to create a reverse mapping database for mapping
      UTF8 characters back to their MARC8 equivalent.

0.3  Tue Dec  3 17:09:23 2002
    - revamped to_utf8() to handle multibyte character sets. It is no longer
      recursive, and didn't really need to be in the first place.
    - created MARC::Charset::EastAsian!

0.2  Sat Oct 19 03:24:22 2002
    - Added the 'Final character' to identify Extended Latin.

0.1  Fri Jul 26 09:10:36 2002
    - Original version
